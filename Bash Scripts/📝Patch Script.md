# 📝 Bash Script Analysis

## 📌 **Description**

This **Bash script** checks whether a given path (provided as an argument) exists and determines whether it is a **file** or a **directory**, displaying relevant information accordingly.

---

## 🔍 **Script Workflow**

### 1️⃣ **Check for Argument Presence**

```bash
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Please pass the path as an argument."
  exit 1
fi
```

- Ensures the script is run with at least **one argument**.
- If no argument is provided, it prompts the user and exits.

### 2️⃣ **Validate if the Path Exists**

```bash
path=$1

if [ ! -e "$path" ]; then
  echo "Path does not exist."
  exit 1
fi
```

- Stores the first argument as `$path`.
- Checks if the **path exists** using `-e`. If not, prints an error message and exits.

### 3️⃣ **Check if the Path is a Directory**

```bash
if [ -d "$path" ]; then
  echo "This is a directory. It contains: "
  ls -l "$path"
```

- If `$path` is a **directory** (`-d` check), it lists its contents using `ls -l`.

### 4️⃣ **Check if the Path is a File**

```bash
elif [ -f "$path" ]; then
  echo "This is the file: "
  cat "$path"
```

- If `$path` is a **file** (`-f` check), it **displays its contents** using `cat`.

### 5️⃣ **Handle Other Cases**

```bash
else
  echo "This is not a file or a directory."
fi
```

- If `$path` is **neither a file nor a directory**, it prints a message indicating this.

## ✅ **Key Features**

✔ **Handles Missing Arguments** → Ensures the script is used correctly.  
✔ **Checks File or Directory** → Differentiates between them.  
✔ **Displays Relevant Information** → Lists directory contents or prints file content.

## ⚡ **Usage Example**

### 📌 Running the script:

```bash
./path_checker.sh /home/user/Documents
```

#### **Example Output (if it's a directory):**

```bash
This is a directory. It contains:
total 2
drwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Mar 10 10:30 Project
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user  512 Mar 10 10:31 notes.txt
```

#### **Example Output (if it's a file):**

```bash
This is the file:
Hello, this is a test file.
```

## 🛠 **Possible Improvements**

1️⃣ **Handle Symbolic Links** → Detect and follow symlinks.  
2️⃣ **Check for Permissions** → Warn if the user lacks read access.  
3️⃣ **Allow Recursive Directory Listing** → Option to display subdirectories.
